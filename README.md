Before page description:
The original landing page was a simple, functional design with a solid blue background and a small, centered login form. It offered minimal explanation about Facebook’s purpose and lacked engaging visuals. The “Create New Account” option was a small text link, making it less prominent. Overall, the layout felt dense and outdated, with limited emotional appeal or clear visual hierarchy.***

***After page description:
The redesigned landing page features a clean, modern layout with a white background and spacious sections. A large, friendly headline clearly communicates Facebook’s purpose, supported by inviting subtext. A prominent “Create New Account” button encourages action, while a warm hero image shows people connecting. The design uses consistent styles, ample white space, and responsive formatting to improve readability and usability on all devices.***
